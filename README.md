# Runway + Unity

A collection of stand alone examples connecting [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) to [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).
Examples are separated by current available models.

## Examples

- [OpenPose](https://github.com/runwayml/examples_unity/tree/master/openpose): This example has Scenes for [receving values](https://github.com/runwayml/examples_unity/tree/master/openpose/receiveOnly/Assets/Scenes) and [receiving values with webcam feed](https://github.com/runwayml/examples_unity/tree/master/openpose/receiveOnly/Assets/Scenes)

## Contributing

This is still a work in progress. Contributions are welcomed!
